# dsa-in-cpp

A collection of common data structures and algorithms that I implemented.

## Overview

### data-structures

- Graph
    - Parent Array Tree Representation
    - Left-Child Right-Sibling Tree Representation
- Heap
    - Heap class and Template: Please note that, to use the Template, a member `int priority` must be implemented in your **own** class objects. Please make sure to assign a priority to each object you want the Heap to be instantiated with.

### sorting-algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### other-algorithms

- Binary Search
- Matrix Product 

## About

This Repository is indended to be a reference for common data structures and algorithms in CS. As I am still learning, my code might not be optimized. However I intend to optimize it whenever I have gained a deeper insight into cpp or the algorithm.

## Contribution

Please feel free to contribute. I am always very happy about ideas and hints for further improvement.
