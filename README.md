## Overview

A collection of common data structures and algorithms that I implemented.

## About

This Repository is indended to be a reference for common data structures and algorithms in CS.

### data-structures

- Graph
    - Parent Array Tree Representation
    - Left-Child Right-Sibling Tree Representation
- Heap
    - Heap class and Template: Please note that, to use the Template, a member `int priority` must be implemented in your **own** class/struct. Please make sure to assign a priority to each object you want the Heap to be instantiated with.
- Fibonacci-Heap
    - An interesting alternative to Binary Heaps are Fibonacci-Heaps. Theoretically they have an interesting performance Profile and are a viable choice to increase the performance of the SSSP Algorithm (aka Dijkstra's Algorithm). However in real-world application it has been shown that the pairing-heap is, with regards to implementation, a simpler and also faster solution compared to the Fibonacci-Heap. 


### sorting-algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### other-algorithms

- Binary Search
- Matrix Product
