A collection of common data structures and algorithms that I implemented.

## About

This Repository is indended to be a reference for common data strucutures and algorithms in CS. As I am still learning, my code might not be optimized. However I intend to optimize it whenever I have gained a deeper understanding about how C++ works.

## Contribution

Please feel free to contribute. I am always very happy about ideas and hints for further improvement.
